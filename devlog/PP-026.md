Alright so I want to get back into working on this game more and writing more updates on the progress of this game. I really like to write the progress, and sometimes a video version.

I recently took a little break and have been getting into playing Minecraft on a single-player world. Also have been dealing with a few other life things that have been getting in the way.

Since it's been a little bit I have to figure out where I last left off. I tried to leave notes all in the code, but not everywhere. I also misplaced my hand written notes for some things. I have been working on our Trello board so I know I can work from there as well.

Alright let's see what I recently added. This is going to be a long *Brew Notes* :

- More NPC's in the testing map such as the Students Witches, A second form of the Gloamfolk, Felix, and Gwen :3
- Added NPC event tags above pretty much every event that the player can trigger. They are marked with Emojis.
- Added all but one classroom for what you have to take. 
- Fixed the Item settings.
That is all I can currently remember, and what I could find in the code.

The recent changes I remember making that were much needed was

- Finally connecting all the maps to the right map
- Added a special emoji to each map (ðŸ’ )
- Removed default sound to move between maps
- Added in maybe 80% code notes to help
- Renamed the events 
- Fixed most tiles per map

The game right now is just in a play state where you leave the testing map to then walk around all the maps to see how the look to how you interact with things. Not everything has text or can be interacted with.

## Why is this so long?

Alright so I was going to divide this into two parts a 0.2.6 and a 0.2.7, but it doesn't feel right and above is just a interlude into the main part of what I'm getting worked on.

While I wasn't fully working on the game in the engine itself I was still doing some things for it such as writing the 70+ books I'm adding, or making some new art for the game's title screen, or even some new card art.

I am also starting to rewrite some of the games intro dialog. It has changed about 4 times now. More adding things on to make it longer to add to the lore. (people like lore). Once I finish writing it I will add it to the game.

At a minimum I need to finish making six custom NPC's. I know for a fact there will be much more customs ones, but I'm not to that point yet.

One thing I really need to get working on is the part for my mom. She's not my mom in the game as it's a different Joy (OC), but there will be many hints and such telling the player that she was my mom and she is going to be missed. Since learning a bit of new info as to what happened I am kind of adding a little quest she gives out. To save her ashes.

### Updates per week

So like I kind of said above I will be writing more of these and I think I want to do it once a week If I fully can remember to be honest.

I will be doing these updates on Tuesdays. I feel like that is generally a good day to make these kind of posts. So expect more work to be put into these Notes and the game itself as I really do want to release this game as well as other games. I like to be a dev. I'm still learning and I can't wait to learn more and share more.
