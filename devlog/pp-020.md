## Alright alchemists, get your herbs, roots, fungus, crystals, and books at the ready because I have finally started to do the major rework on my game Potions Panic!

I am finally excited to at least begin and get the cauldron boiling at least. I stopped this project almost three months ago and when I first started it, I was only going to spend 24hr making it, but it's now 4 or 5 months old as a project. Not that old, but still.

Anyways I will go over some things from the past version v0.1.x and then go over whats all new and some of the future development.
Version 0.1.x

Almost a complete game where you could start it and beat it within an hour, but very buggy, lack of SFX and BGM, lots of spelling errors, images not loading, or even crashing your game. Lots of NPC's, but no life to them. Menu is ugly, broken pixel in GUI, it's not that fun, lacks a ton of basic features. lack of controller support. And so much more.
Whats new in version 0.2.0?

Since I wanted to do away with the RTP (might use a few still idk) I bought some assets to use as well as some other useful things that I would need to help re make this.

- WinLu tiles
- Stella character creator
- RPG Maker MZ
- Game Character Hub
- DarkTower7899 titles
- Steam Dev License
- Asprite
- and others. 

I have spent a good amount of money now to re make this game, and with these new tools and assets I do believe this was the right choice and will make the game stand out a bit more for more reasons then none.

Since I just started this over again I am taking it a bit slower then I was. I am following a flowchart to help me doing it level by level making sure each map and all is evented/scripted right. I am also learning the MZ program over the MV one. There is a bit of stuff I don't know yet.

Right Now the things I have added and done so far:

- Offset the title menu
- Added a new window GUI
- Added in the main party member
- Added in your Professor
- Made two starting maps
- Added the way to start the game
- Added a way(will probably be removed) to end the game real fast with the dark alter
- Added the frog
- Added a temp Game Over screen Image 

No plugins have been added to aid and change with this yet. Still doing some of the basic work and all making a basic to mid intro for all this. I want to release a little play test for the first two maps soon. Parteon first then here. I want to get this at least a better kinda play demo first.

I still need to finish up Frnd-Chkn, its almost finished as it's part of this game series of Potions Panic! Will make a post on that game soon as well.

Alright, I'm off to go make some dinner, find a movie to watch and then finish some of this work and then do art.
