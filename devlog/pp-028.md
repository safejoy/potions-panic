## Where Do I even start?
Alright so I haven't done a lot of work since the last post only because of funds being short and I'm struggling with other life issues more. So with that out of the way, what have I been up too with the brewing of the game?

Well tbh window shopping. Looking at a few plugins and all to buy to help for this game. That and also trying to learn more JavaScript and C++. But I have made some decent progress on the game itself.

With the recent feedback I got from a play tester, I was able to go back and fix a few things.

## Fixes
- All Tilesets had to get updated. Made from a Base Tileset to a child-theme one for each map.
- Updated a plugin so players can read books in game.
- Updated the Emoji list we are using for event labels.
- Fixed the bucket and broom animation.
- Changed the door in the first Hallway to a magic mirror.

These are the recent changes and additions I've made.
## Changes
- Added Saffron's NPC. Currently in the testing map. Not added to the story.
- Added in Mom's NPC. Working her story and mini quest line in currently.
- The starting menu has been shifted over again. Making way for a new menu image. Not finished yet.
- Added Shaming Tom. He deserves it.

## Planned for coming up Patreon releases
You can play my game early as a play tester if you are part of my [Patreon](https://patreon.com/joyflowers). You will get your name in the credits as well if you become a supporter.
- Adding over 70+ readable books. Lore, story, random, silly. Having about 6-11 pages at minimum per book. Just started to write them.
- A hidden personal Developer cookbook with recipes in the game.
- Re drawing some artwork for outlined NPC's.
- A newer or just altered variant of Dusty.
- Finally added in some of the cards per their status of a quest, NPC, or Item. Potions cards and any other cards will be added later.
- Finally setting up the "Main" start, not the full intro, but a start to teach the player some things and then releasing them into the game world for just walking. It's gonna be about a few good months I'd say before I really start implementing the story. Only about 4% of the story is there and that's held together with the visuals.
- Adding controller / Joypad support.
- Fixing keyboard controls. Switch between "WASD" or the arrow keys.

## Mother
This update is mostly in part for her. When I first found out of her passing, I started to make a little place in my game for her to help me cope with the heavy news.

It's now been just over three months since and I'm defiantly not done grieving, but I have calmed down to a point where I can start working on my game again and not feel so bad thinking of her. It hit me hard and I feel guilty for a lot of things left unsaid and all, but I can't keep thinking that way and must keep moving forward, with my game, but more so my own life.

Like I said above her NPC sprite has been added. I had to edit it a bit to more so fit the feel of the game in the moment you get to meet her and such.

This brings up a little thing too, she is my mother, not the protagonists mother. So I am trying to add her in to explain that she's the Developers mom without breaking the forth wall.

Since I was also able to find out some new information on what happened, It made me very upset as her child. So in more of her honor I am making a little mini quest from her where you get to "save" her and then get to shame her husband for doing something bad to her.

## It's slow cause
Alright so I want to say I should have been down with this game, but not counting the adult issues, or the recent passing of my mother that has gotten in my way, I'm getting in my own way, and money.

I could take out some of these promised features and the game will be done in like a few months at most, But since I one want to keep my promise, and two I wanted these in here anyway, It's taken longer since I am trying to budget for my game, my life, and cute dates. 

If I had more funding I would be able to get the remaining things and then I can more heavily work on the game to make it better. So far I have spent just about $320 on the project. I'm estimating I will need about $600 more. That's not counting the Steam Developer cost.

Once I am able to acquire the rest of these assets I will not only be able to finish this game, but also be able to re use them and create other game projects within this game engine. I do plan on doing that, but also I want to start to use others, and even make a In-house engine.

## Mention
I want to at least mention this here as I wont be adding it's own dev notes to the site here, I am also starting a new smaller game project using VX Ace. It has more limitations and such, but myself and many others loved it. It's also kind of making me re learn how to use all of these engines in a way and the Ruby language for scripting.

The game came to me when I was watching a random meme comp. It's pretty much a soldier tasked to deliver a Meme from his king to the nearby kingdom. Since phones or internet wasn't invented yet. You aren't allowed to view the meme during your playthrough or it makes you lose. You only get to see it once it's been delivered.
